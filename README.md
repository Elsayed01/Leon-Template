# Leon Webpage Template

## Project Description

A Webpage Template for Leon organiztion that is designed using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome library.

The webpage consists of a header and welcoming section, in addition to 4 more sections, Services, Portfolio, About, and Contact, in the end we have the footer.

The header has the logo and the dropdown menu which contains the page sections, and the other sections are spread over the entire page.

The webpage layout is responsive  for all the screens (phone, small, medium, large...etc).

Normalize.css is used to make the browser render all the elements consistently and with the modern standards.

** In case you came from the far future after this project is uploaded on my github, most likely you will need the newest version of Font Awesome library so you don't face any problems with the icons on the webpage. so to avoid any problems download the newest version and replace "webfonts" folder with the new one and make sure that webfonts folder is at the same directory as "index.html" file, and replace the "css/all.min.css" with the new file from the new version.

## Functionalities

1- Showing the sections list after hovering on the dropdown menu.

2- "Smooth Scrolling" where clicking on each section from the menu will take you to this section on the page in smooth movement.

3- "Animated Arrow" that is pointing to the dropdown menu after hovering on the dropdown menu icon.
